These are instructions for how to run the ar.drone through your web browser (firefox) through Ubuntu and ROS Hydro

Install Ubuntu 12.04
begin following instructions at:  http://wiki.ros.org/hydro/Installation/Ubuntu
-all repositories are properly allowed by default

install terminal and terminator
add them to the bar on the left side

ros-hydro-desktop-full   Y
this takes some time…
hddtemp - no
some more time…

for reference - https://github.com/AutonomyLab/ardrone_autonomy
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-ardrone-autonomy 

sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-mjpeg-server  

for reference - http://wiki.ros.org/rosbridge_suite
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-rosbridge-server  (this worked fine)
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-rosbridge-suite  (this worked fine)

Install the drone teleop package (excerpt from this old tutorial)
cd ~/ros
svn checkout http://brown-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/experimental/drone_teleop

gedit ~/.bashrc
(add this to the end of the file)
source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=~/ros:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=~/home/obot/:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH (modify this)

close terminal windows and reopen them.  
echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
result should be similar to this without the ‘obot’  : /home/obot/home/obot/:/home/obot/ros:/opt/ros/hydro/share:/opt/ros/hydro/stacks

Turn on the drone and connect to its wifi
run the following in separate terminal windows:
roscore
rosrun rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket
rosrun ardrone_autonomy ardrone_driver
rosrun mjpeg_server mjpeg_server
rosrun drone_teleop drone_teleop.py  // try to takeoff/land with the teleop then I ctrl+c to end it

type this into firefox
http://localhost:8080/stream?topic=/ardrone/image_raw  and see the live feed

then install roswww
cd to /home/obot/ros
git clone https://github.com/tork-a/roswww_pkg.git
ls to see that roswww_pkg is there in the folder
in a new terminal window:
rosrun roswww webserver.py

navigate to the file in your web browser:  in Firefox:  
File < Open File   /home/obot/ros/drone_teleop/www/drone_browser_teleop.html

get the user interface that has more buttons (called yesno3)
cd to /home/obot/ros/drone_teleop/www
git clone https://github.com/JGRBiomed/drone_stuff.git
edit the interface for localhost
gedit drone_browser_teleop_yesno3
save as drone_browser_teleop_yesno3_local
edit lines 10/11 and 216/217  save and close
 in Firefox:  File < Open File  /home/obot/ros/drone_teleop/www/drone_browser_teleop_yesno3_local.html
(I always make it smaller <ctrl -> so that it fits in the screen)

Fly!

Modify the interface to make it how you like it - then share the improved one with us so that we can use it too!

Next, you can share your drone with the world by adding your external IP address to the yesno3 interface and setting up port forwarding on ports 8000, 8080 and 9000.
